                        <p>Coming straight out of University of Southern California as a film major dropout, Maximus Fangâ€™s change in career path and turn to Wall Street has generated his investors over 13.1 billion dollars in return.
                            Averaging an annual 12% return regardless of market condition and cycles in his all weather fund, and close to 63% average returns in his qualitative driven but quantitative back fund AlphaGAINZ, maximus fang is truly a revolutionary and a titan of industry in a fierce and shrinking hedge fund space.
